      <description>Estimation of soil depth in aqp R package Estimation functions for soils try to calculate unknown properties based on existing observations and known relationships. The term pedotransfer function was coined by Johan Bouma as “translating data we have into what we need.” Soil surveys, and especially the primary descriptions collected by field soil scientists, offer many opportunities for leveraging this type of information.&#xA;In Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology aqp, the heuristics are defined in terms of R code.</description>
