      <description>Is it possible to use the GDAL “EEDAI” driver (Google Earth Engine Data API Image; https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/eedai.html) via the terra R package to create a SpatRaster from a Google Earth Engine asset?&#xA;One might ask: why bother trying to get data out of Earth Engine? Well, in order to use data in non-proprietary workflows, perform comparisons to non-public datasets, or preserve various products for reproducibility or historic value, we should want to have (at least subsets of) Earth Engine Assets archived as files on our own servers.</description>
