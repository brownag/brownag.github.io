      <description>Recently I developed two different riffs on the motif of the aqp SoilProfileCollection… Soil profiles are essentially cross-sections for a point, line or area on the land surface where distinct “layers” are defined by a top and bottom depth measurement. There is generally a many:one relationship between layers observed within a soil profile and the site-level information that identifies or summarizes that profile.
soilvctrs soilvctrs is an experimental R package to abstract geometric operations on stratified environmental data such as soil profile descriptions.</description>
